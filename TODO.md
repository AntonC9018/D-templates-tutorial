Topics that interest me most right now:
---------------------------------------

* juxtaposing functions,
* mapping n ranges in parallel,
* Generating random values, whatever the type,
* grouping functions,
* a simple compile-time state machine? (to parse something, for example)

Misc.
-----

* __LINE__ and __FILE__ are described on dlang.org. Link it.
* Index Appendix B.

From the D mailing lists, related to templates (to be put somewhere in the text):

"You can't use methods (delegates) for template parameters, because they need a context, which is not known at compile-time."

"If exactly one of two equally good matched functions is a templated one, the other one is chosen. Now that you have templated the second function, both are an equally good match and both are templated."
